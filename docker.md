# Docker

Docker is a platform that enables developers to create, deploy, and run applications in containers. Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all parts of it, including libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package.

    Containers
  </summary>
  
### What are Containers?
  
Containers are standalone executable packages that include everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, libraries, and system tools. They are lightweight and provide a consistent environment across different stages of development.
  
### Docker Images
  
Docker Images are snapshots of a container that include all the files and dependencies needed to run an application. Images are used to create containers and can be stored in a registry like Docker Hub for sharing and collaboration.
  
### Basic Commands
  
Here are some basic Docker commands:
    
```bash 
docker pull #=> Download an image from a registry.
docker run  #=> Create and start a container from an image.
docker ps   #=> List running containers.
docker stop #=> Stop a running container.
```

    Deployment
  </summary>
  
### Docker Compose
  
Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. It uses a YAML file to configure the application's services, networks, and volumes.
  
### Docker Swarm
  
Docker Swarm is a native clustering and scheduling tool for Docker containers. It turns a pool of Docker hosts into a single virtual host, allowing you to scale your applications easily.
  
### Kubernetes
  
Kubernetes is an orchestration platform that can manage Docker containers. It provides tools for deploying applications, scaling them as necessary, managing changes to existing containerized applications, and optimizing the use of underlying hardware.

   Use Cases
  </summary>
  
### Microservices
  
Docker is commonly used to build and deploy microservices. Containers provide the isolation and consistency needed to manage and scale microservices independently.
  
### Development Environments
  
Docker can create consistent development environments that match production. This helps to eliminate the "it works on my machine" problem and streamlines collaboration between team members.
  
### Testing
  
Docker enables you to automate the testing of your applications in isolated environments, ensuring that tests are consistent and repeatable.

   Networking
  </summary>
  
### Bridge Networks
  
Bridge Networks are the default network type in Docker. They allow containers connected to the same bridge network to communicate, while isolating them from other containers.
  
### Host Networking
  
Host Networking removes the network isolation between the Docker host and the Docker containers. This means the container shares the host's networking namespace, making it useful in scenarios where you want to expose a service directly on the host's IP address.

   Security
  </summary>
  
### Best Practices
  
Security best practices in Docker include using signed images, keeping Docker up to date, limiting container privileges, and using security profiles like AppArmor or SELinux.
  
### Image Scanning
  
Image scanning is a process that scans Docker images for vulnerabilities. Tools like Docker Scan can be used to analyze images and provide a detailed report of known security issues.
